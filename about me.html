          <p> Hello, my name is Axel. I was born 
          in oakland,California. My parents are from Mexico. They 
          come from Oaxaca and Chiapas. I have an older brother 
          and a younger sister which makes me the middle child.D:
          </p><br>
          
          <p> I love playing videogames and going out with 
          my friends or family. I have recently been planning to buy
          a skateboard because I find it fun to use but for now I am still
          pretty bad. School wise I am okay but I find it really boring
          but my favorite subject is math because its pretty easy. Well 
          for now I am just waiting for the future to see how it turns out.</p>
